// This is the top-level module for ECE 3544 Project 3a.
// Do not modify the MODULE DECLARATION or PORTS in this file.
// When synthesizing to the DE1-SoC, this file should be used with the provided
// Quartus project so that the FPGA pin assignments are made correctly.
//
// YOU MUST MAKE THE PIN ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS OF THIS MODULE.
// FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE DOCUMENT ON PIN PLACEMENT.
// CONSULT THE MANUAL FOR INFORMATION ON THE PIN LOCATIONS.

module project3aTop(SW, LED, HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3, HEX4, HEX5);
   input  [9:0] SW;
   output [9:0] LED;
   output [6:0] HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3, HEX4, HEX5;
	 
// This should allow you to see the values of the switches on the LEDs.
// You may leave these instantiations in place in your final submission, since

// Project 3A does not use a different correspondence betwen the switches and
// the LEDS.

   assign LED = SW;

// This maps certain switches to the seven-segment display inputs.
// Use this as an example of instantiating in the top-level module, and as a
// test of your seven-segment displays. 

// STUDY THE BEHAVIOR OF THE TEST MODULE. AFTER YOU HAVE VERIFIED THAT THE
// SEVEN SEGMENT DISPLAYS OPERATE ACCORDING TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE TEST MODULES
// YOU WILL NEED TO REMOVE THESE INSTANTIATIONS SO THAT YOU CAN ASSOCIATE THE
// SEVEN-SEGMENT DISPLAYS WITH THE ELEMENTS OF YOUR CONVERTER SYSTEM.
